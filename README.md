# Projects 

## [XKube](https://github.com/EneVyctis/FirstYearProject), my first project. 
Xkube is a simple game inspired by TicTacToe. We aimed to code that game, implement an AI to play alone and a multiplayer game mode to play with a friend.
The multiplayer server is no longer available tho, cause there is no sense of letting a server run with so few players (mostly me and a friend of mine). 
You can still test it by running the Nodejs server locally. 

## [Weaponator](https://github.com/EneVyctis/Weaponator), a school project. 
Weaponator is an unfinished project (technically, finished for the school standards) of 25 hours (approx.) to learn php with Symfony. 

## [ImprovedXKube](https://github.com/EneVyctis/ImprovedXCube), a cleaner, more powerful, more stable version of XKube.
I want to improve my first-ever project and make it available on the Play Store. The game and server will be coded in C# using Unity and ASP.NET

## [Magic Circus](https://github.com/AdriKat2022/AMJV-CTF).
This project has been made as a school project for our 2nd year of engeering study at Telecom SudParis. 
We needed to create, in pair, a "Capture The Flag" game following some GDD restrictions.

## [Detect](https://github.com/EneVyctis/Detect).
A few hours school project using C language and the ESP32-S3 micro-controller. This project allows the ESP32 to detects the number of people nearby from their wifi and bluetooth connection. 
Largely inspired by [ESP Sniffer example](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/master/examples/network/simple_sniffer)
