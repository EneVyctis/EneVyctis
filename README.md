# Projects 

## [simple-parser](https://github.com/EneVyctis/simple-parser), a functionnal enough parser that i'll use for other project.
As i was about to recreate git in java, or a functionnal enough git i would say, i though that i would do everything from scratch, which includes the parsing of command lines, as git is a command line tool.
simple-parser is born for that purpose, providing a simple yet powerful enough line parser for my usage. It is also cool to think of what is running "under the hood" of command parsers. 

## [Emulatv](https://github.com/EneVyctis/Emulatv), project to learn FullStack dev & watch services on a TV's Display.
Emulatv is your usual Tv internet interface, except it runs on a raspberry and has a phone as a remote controller. You can choose from various services (Netflix-Youtube etc...) add your own and runs it.
This project is a personal project that both covers a use case (I was in need for such system 3 months ago) and a desire to learn fullstack development for web application. 

## [XKube](https://github.com/EneVyctis/FirstYearProject), my first project. 
Xkube is a simple game inspired by TicTacToe. We aimed to code that game, implement an AI to play alone and a multiplayer game mode to play with a friend.
The multiplayer server is no longer available tho, cause there is no sense of letting a server run with so few players (mostly me and a friend of mine). 
You can still test it by running the Nodejs server locally. 

## [Weaponator](https://github.com/EneVyctis/Weaponator), a school project. 
Weaponator is an unfinished project (technically, finished for the school standards) of 25 hours (approx.) to learn php with Symfony. 

## [ImprovedXKube](https://github.com/EneVyctis/ImprovedXCube), a cleaner, more powerful, more stable version of XKube.
I want to improve my first-ever project and make it available on the Play Store. The game and server will be coded in C# using Unity and ASP.NET

## [Magic Circus](https://github.com/AdriKat2022/AMJV-CTF).
This project has been made as a school project for our 2nd year of engeering study at Telecom SudParis. 
We needed to create, in pair, a "Capture The Flag" game following some GDD restrictions.

## [Detect](https://github.com/EneVyctis/Detect).
A few hours school project using C language and the ESP32-S3 micro-controller. This project allows the ESP32 to detects the number of people nearby from their wifi and bluetooth connection. 
Largely inspired by [ESP Sniffer example](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/master/examples/network/simple_sniffer)
